This document is a reference for the GitHub Copilot Workshop Assistant. It contains platform-specific presenter notes, bridging phrases, and important delivery guidelines.

## When Presenting to Mixed Audience

1. **Start with universal concept** — Explain the Copilot feature first
2. **Demo in Swift** — Show the practical example
3. **Show Android parallel** — Reference the Android repo to demonstrate cross-platform applicability
4. **Bridge to other platforms** — "For BE devs, think of this as...", "FE folks, this maps to..."
5. **Use analogies** — Map iOS/Android concepts to equivalent concepts in other stacks
6. **Invite questions** — "Does this map to your architecture?"

## Suggested Phrases for Cross-Platform Bridging

- "I'm showing this in Swift, but we have the same app in Kotlin — the same Copilot features work there too..."
- "For Android developers, think of this SwiftUI View as a Composable function..."
- "Backend folks, this UseCase is similar to your Service layer..."
- "Frontend devs, this ViewModel is like your custom hook or store..."
- "QA team, you can use these same instruction files to define test case formats..."
- "Automation engineers, imagine prompts for generating Page Objects or test fixtures..."
- "Notice how the applyChangesFromIOS prompt automatically translates patterns across platforms — you could create similar migration prompts for any technology pair..."

## Important Delivery Notes

- ✅ **Always provide working code** — Examples must be complete and runnable
- 👁️ **Show, don't just tell** — Every feature needs a visible demonstration
- 📈 **Build progressively** — Each session builds on previous work
- 🛠️ **Keep it practical** — Focus on real-world development scenarios
- ⏰ **Time-conscious** — Content must fit in 30-35 minutes
- 🏢 **Enterprise features** — All Copilot Enterprise features are available
- 🌍 **Cross-platform awareness** — Always include guidance for all streams
- 🤝 **Inclusive language** — Make all attendees feel the content is relevant to them
- 📱 **Dual-repo awareness** — Both iOS and Android repos exist; mention Android parallels where relevant
- 🎨 **Design system awareness** — The project has AppTypography + AppColors; reference these in code examples
